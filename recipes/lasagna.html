    <h1>Lasagna</h1>
    <img src="../img/lasagna.jpg" alt="slice of lasagna in a plate">
    <h2>Needs no introduction a staple of grandma's cuisine</h2>
    <p>For this recipe, we are essentially making a thick, meaty tomato sauce and layering that with noodles and cheese into a casserole. <br> 
        Here's the run-down: <br>

        Start by making the sauce with ground beef, bell peppers, onions, and a combo of tomato sauce, tomato paste, and crushed tomatoes. <br>
        The three kinds of tomatoes gives the sauce great depth of flavor. <br>
        Let this simmer while you boil the noodles and get the cheeses ready. <br>
        We're using ricotta, shredded mozzarella, and parmesan -- <br>
        like the mix of tomatoes, this 3-cheese blend gives the lasagna great flavor! <br>
        From there, it's just an assembly job. <br>
        A cup of meat sauce, a layer of noodles, more sauce, followed by a layer of cheese. <br>
        Repeat until you have three layers and have used up all the ingredients. <br>
        Bake until bubbly and you're ready to eat!</p> <br>
